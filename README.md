# eyeTunes - Music visualizer

Art For Everyone.

A playful app which enables users to create music and animations using their computer keyboard. Keys are mapped to musical notes and animated shapes appear as the user creates sounds. 

Users donâ€™t require any musical or artistic background in order to get audio or visual feedback while they interact with the app.
